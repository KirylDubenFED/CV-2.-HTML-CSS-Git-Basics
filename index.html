        <p>     I have wanted to enter the world of development for a long time, but there was always not enough time due to
            my family commitments. I always had desire to work in IT industry (after leaving school I worked part-time
            in an educational establishment as PC operator).
            My friends and colleagues know me as the go-to person for all computer related problems: from fixing
            internet, testing and installing the correct applications to resolving problems with reinstalling OS.
            I am quick to assimilate new ideas and I am willing to undertake further training to develop new skills. I
            thrive under pressure and challenging working environments.
            <br>
                I try constantly to learn something new to improve my web and programming skills through reading articles
            and work with private tutor.
            In my free time I also enjoy activities which relate to IT such as designing new apps and watching videos
            related coding.
            My favorite book is learn.javascript.ru.
